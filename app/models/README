You can create them by being in the application root directory and running, e.g.,

rake generate:model NAME=User
rake generate:model NAME=Deck
rake generate:model NAME=Card
rake generate:model NAME=Round

rake generate:migration NAME=create_users
rake generate:migration NAME=create_decks
rake generate:migration NAME=create_cards
rake generate:migration NAME=create_rounds
